    "  - a Banach space is a vector space that is complete (e.g. no missing holes, every Cauchy Sequence of its points have a limit also in it) and with definition of a norm (thus can calculate distance). Thus $\\mathbf{R}^{m}$ is a typical banach space\n",
    "  - a functional space is also a vector space, of infinite dimensions\n",
    "  - a banach algebra defined on a set can be a bounded functional space on this set, which is a vector space, which can have its functional dual space of all linear functionals, which can be proven to have the same dimensions as the original functional(vector) space, which is infinite\n",
    "  - A linear functional f maps a linear subspace (e.g. a convex cone) of a vector space to a scalar field (real/complex), such that $f(\\alpha x + \\beta y) = \\alpha f(x) + \\beta f(y)$\n",
    "  - $B(\\Omega)$ can be thought as function that maps subset of $\\Omega$ (compact or not) to \"Area\" or \"Volume\", a Probability Measure is a function defined in $B(\\Omega)$'s dual space of linear functionals to map \"Volume\" to Probability, such that for Random Variables A, B of the same measure $\\textit{P}$ : $\\textit{P}(aX + bY) = a\\textit{P}(X)+b\\textit{P}(Y)$\n",
    "  - a discrete space can also be compact, as long as it's finite\n",
    "  - a compact market is never possible, it needs negligible transaction costs and also perfect information\n",
    "\n",
    "- since we assume X is bounded (a reasonable assumption for financial market), $\\Omega$ is a bounded set usually centered near(or not) x, there must exist a smallest closed cone $\\{ <X, \\Pi> : \\Pi \\in \\textit{P} \\}$ containing the range of X: $\\Omega$\n",
    "- why it is a cone?\n",
    "  - X is a function that maps a vector x (a linear subspace of $\\mathbf{R}^{m}$) to a set of vectors $\\Omega$ (sample space), note that X is not a linear functional\n",
    "  - $\\Pi$ is a function that maps a Banach Algebra in $\\Omega$ to a scalar probability, it is a linear functional\n",
    "  - the inner product of these 2 functions are an integral of 2 functions (which would result in a vector * scalar = vector) over $\\Omega$. Note that for inner product to be defined between functions, at least one function needs to resides in Banach Space, which in this case, is measure $\\Pi$, as it is a linear functional of a Banach Space(Algebra)\n",
    "  - if $\\Pi$ is not constrained, $\\{ <X, \\Pi> : \\Pi \\in \\textit{P} \\}$ is naturally the smallest cone containing $\\Omega$\n",
    "  - if market is Arbitrage-Free, the price deflator is simply a measure to find x in a cone, if market is complete, the measure is unique \n",
    "\n",
    "- if x belong to the cone, the position set up cost cannot be negative (contrapositive)\n",
    "- it is a well known result(non-trivial) that since a cone is closed and convex and x is not in the cone, there must be an arbitrage cone (proof omitted)\n",
