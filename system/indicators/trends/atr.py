class TrueHigh(Indicator):

    Defined by J. Welles Wilder, Jr. in 1978 in his book *"New Concepts in
    Technical Trading Systems"* for the ATR

    Records the "true high" which is the maximum of today's high and
    yesterday's close

    Formula:
      - truehigh = max(high, close_prev)

    See:

class TrueLow(Indicator):
    '''

    Technical Trading Systems"* for the ATR

    Records the "true low" which is the minimum of today's low and
    yesterday's close

    Formula:
      - truelow = min(low, close_prev)

class TrueRange(Indicator):
    '''
    Defined by J. Welles Wilder, Jr. in 1978 in his book New Concepts in
    Technical Trading Systems.

    Formula:
      - max(high - low, abs(high - prev_close), abs(prev_close - low)

      which can be simplified to

      - max(high, prev_close) - min(low, prev_close)

    See:
      - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average_true_range

    The idea is to take the previous close into account to calculate the range
    if it yields a larger range than the daily range (High - Low)
